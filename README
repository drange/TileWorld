This is a pedagogical framework written in Java for creating simple
search algorithms, either uninformed (like BFS, DFS, IDDFS, etc.) or
informed search (like A*, Greedy Best First, etc.).

One can copy the BfsSolver in the Solver package to use as a template,
and on that build other more advanced search algorithms.

Settings are in GameSpec.java, and Main.java contains the class it
will use to search.
